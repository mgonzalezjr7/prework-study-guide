# <PreWork-Study-Guide>

## Description

As a coding bootcamp student, I needed a place to write down all my notes for this course. That being said, developing this webpage has helped me understand the fundamentals of frontend development and will help me better understand the contents being taught as it will hold all my notes throughout this course.
